Dear parent,

I am pleased to share {{student.name}}'s weekly progress report with you:

Your student's attendance rate was {{student.attendance_rate}}.
The class's average attendance rate was {{ (student.get_class_average_attendance() * 100)|round(1) }}%.
The goal for college and career readiness is 94%.

{% if student.attendance_distance < 0 %}
Your child's average attendance rate of {{(student.attendance_rate * 100)|round(1)}}% is below their classmates' average attendance rate of {{ (student.get_class_average_attendance() * 100)|round(1) }}%. Please help them understand the importance of waking up early and getting to school on time.
{% endif %}
