Dear parent,

I am pleased to share {{name}}'s weekly progress report with you:

Your student's attendance rate was {{ (attendance_rate * 100) | round(1) }}%.
The class's average attendance rate was {{ (class_avg_attendance * 100)|round(1) }}%.
The goal for college and career readiness is 94%.

{% if (attendance_rate - class_avg_attendance) < 0 %}
Your child's average attendance rate of {{(attendance_rate * 100)|round(1)}}% is below their classmates' average attendance rate of {{ (class_avg_attendance * 100)|round(1) }}%. Please help them understand the importance of waking up early and getting to school on time.
