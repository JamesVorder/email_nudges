# Attendance Nudger #

This application was developed in partnership with Mind The Gap, Boston, 501(c)3. 

## Building The Application ##

This cross-platform app was generated by [Briefcase](https://github.com/pybee/briefcase) - part of [The BeeWare Project](https://pybee.org/.)

First, download the source code and navigate to the project dir.

```
git clone https://github.com/JamesVorder/email_nudges.git
cd ./email_nudges
```

Then, you'll want to create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

`python3 -m venv ./.py3env`

You can now activate the virtual environment.

`. ./.py3env/bin/activate`

Finally, install all of the requirements into the virtual environment.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Depending on the desired *output*, run one of the following commands from your python3 virtual environment:
- `python build.py linux -s`
- `python build.py macos -s`
- `python build.py windows -s`

The builds will be placed in a folder corresponding to the output you chose.
